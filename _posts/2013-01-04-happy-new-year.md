Happy new year everyone! Just let go of 2012, start 2013 with passion and spirit!

2012 was a nice year after all. I didn&#8217;t achieve much in programming contests last year. But I finally got the one that I dreamed of, an OSN medal!Â  I got bronze in OSN 2012 in Informatics or often called Computer Science. Although it wasn&#8217;t gold, but I&#8217;m very grateful for it. I struggled day and night, fighting my rivals, and went through selection after selection. From school, to OSK, to OSP, and then OSN. The other major achievement that I got was to be the big 16 of Tim Olimpiade Komputer Indonesia, after I passed the first stage of Pelatnas selection. I&#8217;m very grateful for it, too. :)

This year, my major passion will be thriving to pass the national exam, and to enter university. ITB, UI, or abroad, many possibilities and chances are open for now.

I hope that this year will be a good year for me, and for you too. :)
