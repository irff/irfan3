Sometimes you just have to follow the river stream to find what you&#8217;re looking for. Let go all of the resistances and close your eyes. Be like water, don&#8217;t try to crush the stone, but surround it, find another way around. Flow. Enjoy the journey and don&#8217;t expect anything from your destination. Be open to surprise. Let happiness flows and experience gathers.
