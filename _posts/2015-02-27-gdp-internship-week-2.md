        In the second week of my internship at GDP I was given the list of projects to choose, and I ended up choosing a project that compelled to me the most. What I had to do was to create a pre-configured Jenkins image on Docker, so that when the company launch a new project requiring Jenkins, they can just run the docker image instead of manually installing and configuring Jenkins from scratch. 
        
        This project was very challenging, because I didn't have any experience with Docker and Jenkins yet. The previous week, we (the interns) were given a training on installing and using Jenkins as a continuous integration server, so I have a bit of light on what Jenkins is. The rest of the week I spent on reading the official Docker documentation, and watching various technical talks on Youtube. My favorite so far is an Introduction to Docker by (Solomon Hykes at Twitter University)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5POuMHxW-0].

Another important event this week, GDP Labs was moving from the KS Tubun Office to Citicon Tower at Slipi. The former office will be used as the headquarter of Blibli.com, a fast growing sister company of GDP.
