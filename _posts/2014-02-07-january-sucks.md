Okay, I learned that January sucks. That moment when you&#8217;re so enthusiastic about what you&#8217;re going to do in this whole year, that moment when you set resolutions, not thinking whether they will work out or not. And they didn&#8217;t.

A month had passed and I’m still feeling strange with my resolutions. To read more, yes I definitely read more. But to write more, I can’t do it yet. I’ve never written anything on my blog on January. Even worse than any previous months I spent without having a target in mind.

Or maybe, targets and goals frighten me. Which is why I kept resolutions to not achieve anything but keep on doing something. But it was the same. Sigh.

For the next eleven months, I will try to be as natural as possible.
