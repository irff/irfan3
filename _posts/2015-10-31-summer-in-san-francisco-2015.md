title: "A Summer in San Francisco"
---

It’s been a month since I came back from San Francisco to do my internship at Twitter, and I haven’t written a single word about my experiences there. So in the next few weeks, I will post some writings about how I ended up going there, what I did there, what I learned, and what’s next.

San Francisco is a very beautiful city, I love it so much from the moment I got there until the day I was leaving. The people, the community, the places, and the vibrant atmosphere are just so perfect. In a long list of the must visited spots in the City, I managed to visit some: The Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman’s Wharf, Twin Peaks, Golden Gate Parks, Alcatraz Island, and some more. Doing touristy things is just one of the best way to experience the city (which I did during the weekends), but there are more! Stay tuned!
