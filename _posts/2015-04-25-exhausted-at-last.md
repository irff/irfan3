    This last few months, I have no idea why my life could be this hard. Not hard in the sense that it is, hard, but hard in the sense that there's so much thing to do while you only have a little time. I remember that I got many offers to do many things, mostly I reject them, leaving a few that I thought I could handle. I've never been so wrong.
    
    I should say no more often. In fact, I should say no every time. And I shouldn't offer my time easily. I was overconfident, and this resulted in a life so messy that I wish I lived without anything to do at all. The resulting stress felt so heavy, and I was under-performing in any task that was assigned to me.
    
    It is so hard saying no.
