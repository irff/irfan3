Everybody made the same mistakes again and again. They didn&#8217;t realize that our earth is one. They kept burning, mining, bombing, drilling and building everywhere. They made one side of they earth brighter, cleaner and better; but they left the other side darker, full of clutter and rubbish, and worse.

They thought that our earth is a hard disk, they kept filling it with files and rubbish without cleaning and fix it. They kept busy working on it. Knowing that a new version of it, with more storage capacity and more features, will be able to hold their future files. And then they left the old, outdated one, and didn&#8217;t care with it anymore.

Remember, now, our earth is only one. I didn&#8217;t resist that someday, we will have a new earth, just like we have a new version of hard drive. But, how if we won&#8217;t?
