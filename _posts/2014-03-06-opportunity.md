If opportunity knocks, be sure we are ready to catch them. Opportunity may be considered as luck for some people. And we know that luck is not an objective thing. We can&#8217;t really master or tame luck. Luck is all about magic, and there&#8217;s no science behind it.

There are successful people out there, not just the lucky-considered success, but real successful people. People who gain success many times, not just once. Luck never come out more than once, so many successes couldn&#8217;t be considered as luck. It is a merit. And luck is not a merit.

Merit is when you catch an opportunity at the right time, at the right place. And it is a lifelong experience to build merit, it&#8217;s not a one-night-trained skill. Yes, we can&#8217;t predict opportunities. They came slapping our face, so suddenly that after just a blink away, they will gone. So there must be a strategy in managing opportunity, like those successful people do.

The only thing is, be ready all the time to catch every opportunity that comes to you. How? Well, that depends on what plan are you in. If you want to be a writer, be sure you always had writings on your mind, so that when someone offered a book contract, you don&#8217;t just turned it down. If you want to be a chef, be sure to practice every day, so when an opportunity to show up on TV comes to you, you are ready to perform.

Well, the reality is that those opportunity is just a few. But if you don&#8217;t ready at all, you gain nothing.

Even when opportunities doesn&#8217;t come at all, you are ready to make your own stance, build your own opportunity, and at best give opportunities to others. There&#8217;s nothing to lose at being ready to war, should the enemy strikes your gate, you are ready to pick up your sword and get some killing.

Opportunities at best is opportunities that came to people who are ready to get them. So take your stance!
