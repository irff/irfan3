    This January 2015, I had the opportunity to work as a software engineering intern at GDP Labs. GDP Labs is the sister company of Kaskus, Blibli.com, DailySocial, and other companies. I first knew GDP when my fellow TOKI friends from UI and I were invited to have lunch at their office last year.
    
    The first few days, we have some trainings. On the #1st day, we are introduced to the working environment at GDP Labs, and then we were given some books marked as required readings. It's Clean Code, Inspire, and Agile Testing.
    
    Still in the first week, we learn things that weren't given at schools and we also learn how to do things properly. Then we are given some projects to choose, most of them are infrastructure related, and I choose what I'm most interested in: Jenkins and Docker.

The first few days, we have some trainings. On the #1st day, we are introduced to the working environment at GDP Labs, and then we were given some books marked as required readings. It&#8217;s Clean Code, Inspire, and Agile Testing.

Still in the first week, we learn things that weren&#8217;t given at schools and we also learn how to do things properly. Then we are given some projects to choose, most of them are infrastructure related, and I choose what I&#8217;m most interested in: Jenkins and Docker.
