  1. Checked out from my loveliest dorm ever, with my belongings packed.
  2. That also means I&#8217;ve checked out from the school. Three years of memories will be remembered for the rest of my life.
  3. University of Indonesia, here I come. I&#8217;m very grateful to be a part of this awesome campus.
  4. TestingÂ  my luck to live in Jakarta. With no prior experience living in a city full of busyness, I&#8217;m trying my best to cope with everything.
  5. Orientasi Belajar Mahasiswa. Kegiatan seru dan bermanfaat, dapet ilmu baru, pengalaman baru, dan temen baru tentunya.
  6. Paduan suara mahasiswa baru. Balairung riuh dengan gema nyanyian lebih dari tiga ribu mahasiswa baru.
  7. A new life, a new hope. :)
  8. It is when I found someone, that made me realize something important.
  9. This month is one of the most exciting month in the last three years. A total revolution. I have to adapt to everything new. 
 10. It was a really dawning June!
