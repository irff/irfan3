In the last few months my life had been a hectic one. Works came and passed and came again. Appointments were made. Lots of them kept, few broken. Commitments were made. And I kept most of them to this minute. But I had to discard some of my important commitments, because I had to keep my head sane.

I&#8217;m sorry for not joining Best Wanna Be UI 2013. I&#8217;m sorry for not actively participating in PMB Fasilkom 2013. Â It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not serious at everything. It&#8217;s mainly because of my list of priorities stacked up so high, that I couldn&#8217;t barely manage anymore. I have to work to keep my finance safe. I do web designs as a freelancer, and I teach Olympiad lessons twice a week. I have household things to do at my dershane, I do cooking and other weird stuffs.

I have side projects to do. I have deadlines to watch.

Those days were crazy, and so the forthcoming days are. I couldn&#8217;t enjoy my hobbies anymore. I barely do any writings, even I failed to update this blog on time. My reading frequency lessens, my to-read list hasn&#8217;t changed at all. Even I read Quran less.

Maybe this is the hard part of transitioning from my high school mindset into a university one. Those days were crazy, yes, but I&#8217;m steadily improving to reorganize my life.
