I am fortunate to live in a time where anyone could make an impact in the world no matter who he is, no matter who he was.

I am fortunate to live in an era where anything could be learned, where the only limitation is my will and persistence to act.

I am fortunate to have been born from a simple family in a place so close to nature, so that I can grasp the value of life in rural areas of a developing country.

I am fortunate to have been raised by many warm hands and hearts, that allowed me to grow and understand life from different and sometimes contradicting perspective.

I am fortunate to be able to continously grow. From a simple boy lived in an almost extreme poverty into a conscious young man so passionate about everything.

I am fortunate to be surrounded with many brilliant minds, that directly or indirectly inspire me to be a better version of myself every day.

I am fortunate to live in a country with culture so diverse and beautiful. Where morals are kept high, and everyone is your brother.

I am fortunate to live in a city, in a campus where technology come earlier than anywhere in the country.

I am fortunate to have high passion in learning something new every day.

I am fortunate to accumulate so much experience from people I respect, from places I love, and from books I adore.

I am fortunate to live by myself for almost seven years, where I can lighten my family&#8217;s load. This teaches me almost everything I need to survive in life.

I am fortunate to have a simple lifestyle, where I&#8217;m not ashamed with things that others have and I don&#8217;t.

I am fortunate to have a skill where everyone would have deserve it. I may realize that I took it for granted, where in fact I just worked harder on it than everyone else day and night for years.

I am fortunate to have so many people supported me without wanting anything in return. I&#8217;m so grateful and I thank them for everything and every help they have given.

I am fortunate to live in a time where uncertainty is the most certain thing, and thrive under such condition.

I am fortunate to live an amazing life where should it end today, I can go out with a smile.

I am fortunate to realize the fact that I am a fortunate person.
