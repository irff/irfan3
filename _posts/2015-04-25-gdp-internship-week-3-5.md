    In the third week of my internship, the interns finally relocated into the new office which was much more luxurious than the old office. We were given a space inside a glass room with full landscape view of western Jakarta. After learning something about Docker including the technologies, its use case, its development, and its history, then I begin to try Docker on my own.
    
    I tried Docker on my laptop using Boot2Docker, but it turns out that it takes a very long time (more than half an hour) just to download an image from the Docker Hub. Because each of us were given an AWS account, I install Docker on an EC2 instance.  It was blazingly fast, because the network latency is really low, I could download an image in seconds.
