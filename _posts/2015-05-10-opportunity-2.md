  - Opportunities come and go. What you thought would be an opportunity to push your life forward can drag you down. Their outcome depends on your actions and reactions, but no one is a fore teller, the future is a mystery to all of us. Tons of opportunities will come, yet we only have so little time. Be ready to toss most of them, pick a few, and its best to only pick one. Remember that an opportunity that you can control is much more valuable than a bunch of them out of control.
